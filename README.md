Hi and welcome to my test response!

Please run with `npm install` then `npm start`, using node 14 or so dude to headaches with node-sass

I hit most of the marks but there's no PR as I pushed early to the repo from VS Code, and in trying to make a new branch to compare and PR with, I apparantly made one so different that github won't let me make a PR at all?

So that's been interesting.
